# 3DGame

This is an English learning racing game made with Unity.

The aim of this assignment are to learn these important techniques when creating a 3d game.

- The controls
Here we could use W, A, S, D or arrow buttons to control the direction of this car going.

- Gravity and force
The avatar and game objects are rigid bodies and collisions which makes it more like the reality. Also, some affects are triggered by collision.

- AI Co-learning
There's an avatar using as an AI to help player play the game. It gives different reaction according to player's behaviour/actions, shows sample to player like how to play the game and also giving hints to player.

- Level of difficulty
There are two levels in this game, the difference between them are not only the car speed becomes faster also the words to be learned are harder. I also build a quiz after each level to make sure the player does learn the words/vocabularies.

- Sound effects
Having this to make the game more complete and also increase the user experience.
